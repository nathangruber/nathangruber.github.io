<p>My experience, skills, and strengths I personally bring to Blake's stretch over decades. I was born and raised in Peru by on a ranch where I learned most of my skills that I now use in my current profession.<br>

Growing up, my family raised chickens, pigs and cattle for the butcher shop that my father owned. When I became old enough, I opened and ran my own successful butcher shop in Peru for 10 years which I left to my sister to come here, to the USA.<br> 

Being involved with this process all throughout my childhood and early adult life has led me to aspire to opening the same type of business here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<br>

These past experiences have helped me understand the hard work and dedication needed to be successful in this industry. The biggest driving factor behind my business is that I also want my grandaughter Blake to grow up with a more organic lifestyle and learn what it means to eat healthy. She understands the importance of knowing where food comes from, and how animals have been treated.<br>

Our butcher shop will work as shops did 50 years ago, just like when I helped my parents in their business. It all starts by team members contacting, visiting, selecting, pricing and buying all kinds of livestock and products of farmers (cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, calves, etc.) as well as cheese, vegetables, milk, and anything we will need for our business.</p></div>
