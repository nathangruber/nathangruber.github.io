	"text":"<p class=\"blogPosts\">I wanted to share the knowledge I learned today about Javascript Scope and Closures. I found the tutorial on W3 schools very informative. In Javascript variables can belong to the local or global scope. A local variable can only be used inside the function where it is defined. It is hidden from other functions and other scripting code. Global and local variables with the same name are different variables. Modifying one, does not modify the other. Private variables can be made possible with closures in Javascript. My deep thought on this is that you should know this if you are venturing into Javascript frameworks and libraries.<\/p>"

	"title":"Deep Thoughts on the "this" keyword in Javascript, the basics.", 
	"text":"<p class=\"blogPosts\"> "This" keyword in Javascript can be very confusing to a new developer. The javascript.isSexy blog explains it well. The blog runs through the basics, and clearly defines the different uses for the keyword. I read this post so I can understand the keyword better because I am starting to use Object Oriented Programming in Javascript. If you are in a similiar situation or just want to review it is an excellent blog. The blog was written in 2013, but remains spot on. Deep thoughts on "this" is that it is vital to know if you are going to use OOP in Javascript or other coding languages. <\/p>"
