	"text":"<p class=\"blogPosts\">I wanted to share the knowledge I learned today about Javascript Scope and Closures. I found the tutorial on W3 schools very informative. In Javascript variables can belong to the local or global scope. A local variable can only be used inside the function where it is defined. It is hidden from other functions and other scripting code. Global and local variables with the same name are different variables. Modifying one, does not modify the other. Private variables can be made possible with closures in Javascript. My deep thought on this is that you should know this.<\/p>"
